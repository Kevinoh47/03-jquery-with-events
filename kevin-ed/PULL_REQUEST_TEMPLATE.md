#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we worked on the daily kata.
  2. Next, we began pair programming on 03-jquery-with-events. We added the articleView.js in last position for js links, and then we built the list of authors for the author filter.
  3. Next, we switched driver and navigator.
